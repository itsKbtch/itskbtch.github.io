		I feel nervous in a way that can't be named<br>
		I dreamt last night of a sign that read, "the end of love"<br>
		And I remember thinking<br>
		Even in my dreaming it was a good line for a song
		</p>
		<p>
		We're a family pulled from a flood<br>
		You tore the floorboards up<br>
		And let the river rush in<br>
		Not wash away, wash away
		</p>
		<p>
		We were reaching in the dark<br>
		That summer in New York<br>
		And it was so far to fall<br>
		But it didn't hurt at all<br>
		And let it wash away, wash away
		</p>
		<p>
		And in a moment of joy and fury I threw myself<br>
		From the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me<br>
		I've always been in love with you<br>
		Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?
		</p>
		<p>
		We're a family pulled from a flood<br>
		You tore the floorboards up<br>
		And let the river rush in<br>
		Not wash away, wash away<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		We were reaching in the dark (wash away)<br>
		That summer in New York (wash away)<br>
		And was it so far to fall (wash away)<br>
		Said it didn't hurt at all<br>
		And let it wash away, wash away
		</p>
		<p>
		And Joshua came down from the mountain<br>
		With a tablet in his hands<br>
		Told me that he loved me, yeah<br>
		And then ghosted me again
		</p>
		<p>
		We were reaching in the dark<br>

		Reaching in the dark (wash away)<br>
		That summer in New York (wash away)<br>
		And was it so far to fall (wash away)<br>
